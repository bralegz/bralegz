Backend Developer
-----------------

Shortly after earning my degree in Civil Engineering, I discovered a strong interest in programming and software development, which marked the beginning of my self-learning journey. After several years of independent study, I realized I lacked connections in the software development field and wanted to gain experience as part of a development team. To bridge this gap, I enrolled in a bootcamp, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with amazing people and work on exciting projects. Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge by exploring cloud services (particularly AWS) and integrating AI into software development projects, specifically AI powered chatbot integration.
